# Wildlife-Intrusion-Alert-System
"An IoT-based Wildlife Intrusion Detection System using PIR/IR sensors, cameras, and AI image recognition to detect wild animals in real time. Alerts are sent instantly to locals or officials. Powered by NodeMCU/ESP32 and solar energy, it's ideal for rural areas to prevent human-wildlife conflict."
# 🐾 IoT-Based Wildlife Intrusion Detection System

This project presents an **IoT-based Wildlife Intrusion Detection System** designed to prevent harmful interactions between humans and wild animals near forest borders and agricultural areas.

As wildlife intrusion continues to threaten farms, property, and lives, traditional monitoring methods often fail to provide timely and automated warnings. This system offers a smart, real-time detection solution that combines motion sensors, cameras, and AI-based image recognition to detect wild animals and send alerts to nearby residents or forest officials.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Arduino IDE / C++** – For programming microcontrollers
- **Firebase Realtime Database** – For storing and accessing intrusion data
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** – To send real-time alerts to users
- **ESP8266 / ESP32 (Wi-Fi Modules)** – For network communication and sensor data handling

## 📡 IoT Devices & Components

- **PIR / IR / Ultrasonic Sensors** – To detect movement or presence of wildlife
- **ESP8266 / ESP32** – Wi-Fi-enabled microcontrollers
- **Camera Module** – To capture image/video of the detected object
- **Power Supply** – Battery, adapter, or solar panel

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The system continuously monitors the defined area using PIR/IR sensors.
2. When motion is detected, a camera captures an image or video.
3. AI-based logic identifies if the moving object is a wild animal.
4. If confirmed, alerts are sent through Firebase Cloud Messaging.
5. Data is stored and viewable remotely through Firebase Realtime Database.

## 🌱 Future Improvements

- Integration with SMS or voice call alert systems
- GPS location tagging of intrusion
- Use of edge AI models for faster local image recognition
- Mobile app for live monitoring and configuration
